IV: The effect of different ages(10,20,30,40,50years)

DV: Reflex arc(how much time taken to react(Stop watch)

CV: Gender, music(music pitch) and volume(gender-keeping a boy for every age)(I will keep the same music and the same volume of 70 decibel, even the pitch with it contains high and low and the rock song for every age)

Hypothesis: How does different ages(10,20,30,40,50Years) affect the reflex arc(How much time taken to react using the stopwatch)by keeping the gender(keeping a boy for every age), music(music pitch) and volume(I will keep the same music and the same volume of 70 decibel, even the pitch with it contains high and low and the calm song for every age) constant.

Safety apparatus: 1)Safety kit for securing ears 

Materials(tools): Stopwatch, laptop and earphones

Method:

Step1:Prepare the materials and the safety apparatus ready before the investigation

Step2:Choose any age category, make them hold the stopwatch and put the earphones

Step3:Play the music keeping 70 decibel and when it start tell make them start the stopwatch 

Step4:Let the time on going when the high pitch sound comes suddenly make them stop the time

Step5: Record the data, how much time taken to react the high pitch sound

Step6: Do two more trials for this age category and take 3 trial each for other age group using the same method
